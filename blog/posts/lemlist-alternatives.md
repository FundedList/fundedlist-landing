Lemlist was first to nail personalized cold email. Custom images, videos, dynamic text. It changed how sales teams think about outbound.

But Lemlist has problems.

Teams ditch it because of:

- **Deliverability sucks:** Your emails land in spam, not inboxes
- **Weak prospecting:** Built-in contact finding is terrible  
- **Pricing gets brutal:** Costs add up fast as you scale
- **Too complex:** All those personalization features slow you down
- **CRM integration issues:** Doesn't play nice with some popular CRMs

If you're shopping for alternatives, you're probably dealing with at least one of these. Here are 7 options that fix different pieces of the cold email puzzle.

## 1. Apollo.io - Best All-in-One Alternative

- **Better deliverability:** Conservative sending practices protect your reputation
- **Complete workflow:** Find contacts, send sequences, track results
- **Free tier:** Actually useful free plan
- **Less complex:** Easier setup than Lemlist's feature maze

**Best for:** Teams that want prospecting and outreach in one tool.

**The catch:** Personalization features aren't as fancy as Lemlist's.

**Budget:** Factor in subscription costs and conversion rate improvements.

**Technical comfort:** How much complexity can your team handle?
