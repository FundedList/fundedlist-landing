Clay revolutionized B2B data enrichment. 75+ data sources, waterfall workflows, high accuracy rates. It's become the gold standard for RevOps teams who obsess over data quality.

But Clay has serious downsides:

- **Steep learning curve:** Complex interface that requires serious training
- **Too technical:** Building workflows requires technical skills  
- **Gets expensive:** Usage-based pricing adds up fast
- **Feature overload:** More capabilities than most teams need
- **Setup hell:** Significant time investment to build effective workflows
- **Overkill:** Complex solution for simple contact finding

If you're shopping for alternatives, you probably want simpler workflows, better pricing, or tools that balance data quality with ease of use. Here are 7 options that solve different data enrichment challenges.

## Before You Switch

Think about:

**Complexity tolerance:** How much time can your team invest in setup and training?

**Data needs:** Need comprehensive enrichment or specific data types?

**Technical skills:** How comfortable is your team with APIs and workflow building?

**Volume:** How many records per month?

**Budget:** Subscription costs and implementation time.

**Data sources:** Specific data sources or general B2B info?

## Power vs Simplicity

Clay is incredibly powerful. Its multi-source approach and sophisticated workflows achieve enrichment results other tools can't match. But that power comes with complexity most teams don't need.

For most sales teams, Apollo.io gives effective enrichment with a fraction of the complexity.

If you're targeting funded startups specifically, FundedList's pre-enriched approach skips complex enrichment workflows entirely.

For teams with enterprise budgets, ZoomInfo offers comparable data quality with simpler implementation.

Don't overwhelm your team with unnecessary complexity. Pick tools that match your data quality needs without the headache.
