Clay has revolutionized B2B data enrichment by combining 75+ data sources into sophisticated workflows. With its waterfall approach and high accuracy rates, it's become the go-to choice for revenue operations teams who prioritize data quality above all else.

## Making the Switch: What to Consider

When choosing a Clay alternative, consider:

**Complexity tolerance:** How much time can your team invest in setup and training?

**Data needs:** Do you need comprehensive enrichment or specific data types?

**Technical skills:** How comfortable is your team with APIs and workflow building?

**Volume requirements:** How many records do you need to enrich per month?

**Budget:** Factor in both subscription costs and implementation time.

**Data sources:** Do you need specific data sources or general B2B information?

## The Simplicity vs. Power Trade-off

Clay is incredibly powerful. Its multi-source approach and sophisticated workflows can achieve data enrichment results that other tools can't match. But that power comes with complexity that many teams don't need.

For most sales teams, Apollo.io provides effective enrichment with a fraction of the complexity. If you're specifically targeting funded startups, FundedList's pre-enriched approach eliminates the need for complex enrichment workflows entirely. And for teams with enterprise budgets, ZoomInfo offers comparable data quality with simpler implementation.

The key is choosing tools that match your data quality needs without overwhelming your team with unnecessary complexity.
