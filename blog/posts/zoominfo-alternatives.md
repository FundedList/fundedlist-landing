ZoomInfo owns the B2B contact database space. 300 million contacts, solid search filters, and pretty much every enterprise sales team uses it.

The problem? It's stupid expensive.

ZoomInfo starts at $14,995 per year for their Professional plan. You're locked into annual contracts. And their sales team will hound you for price increases every renewal.

The data accuracy is decent but not perfect. Plus the platform feels like it was built by engineers for engineers. Way too complex if you just need good contact info.

If you're looking at ZoomInfo alternatives, you're probably dealing with:

- **Brutal pricing:** $15k+ puts it out of reach for most growing companies
- **Stale data:** Contacts that bounce or go to dead email addresses  
- **Contract hell:** Annual commitments with zero flexibility
- **Feature bloat:** You wanted contacts, not a NASA control panel
- **Terrible support:** Long waits and pushy upselling every interaction

Here are 7 alternatives that actually solve these problems.

## 1. Apollo.io - Best Overall Alternative

**What it is:** Contact database + email sequences + phone dialing in one platform. 275M+ contacts.

**Why it's better than ZoomInfo:**
- **Pricing:** Starts at $49/month. Has a free plan that actually works.
- **All-in-one:** No juggling between tools for contacts and outreach
- **Data quality:** Pretty solid accuracy, gets updated regularly  
- **Actually usable:** Clean interface that doesn't require a PhD
- **Flexible:** Monthly billing available

**Best for:** Teams that want everything in one place without the enterprise tax.

**The catch:** Some advanced search filters aren't as deep as ZoomInfo's.

## 2. Clay - Best for Data Nerds

**What it is:** Data enrichment that pulls from 75+ sources to find contacts automatically.

**Why it's better:**
- **Coverage:** Combines multiple databases so you don't miss people
- **Automation:** Waterfall enrichment finds contacts ZoomInfo can't
- **Accuracy:** Real-time verification = fewer bounces
- **Pay per result:** Only pay when they actually find a contact

**Best for:** RevOps teams who want the best data and don't mind getting technical.

**The catch:** Steeper learning curve than plug-and-play databases.

## 3. Outreach.io - Best for Big Teams

**What it is:** Enterprise sales platform with built-in prospecting database.

**Why it works:**
- **Integration:** Prospecting flows right into outreach sequences  
- **Enterprise ready:** Analytics and team management that actually scale
- **Data quality:** Good accuracy with regular updates
- **Workflow power:** Complex automation for sophisticated teams

**Best for:** Large sales teams that need serious automation.

**The catch:** Expensive and overkill for smaller teams.

## 4. FundedList - Best for Targeting Funded Startups

**What it is:** Weekly lists of recently funded startups with verified founder contacts.

**Why it beats ZoomInfo for startup outreach:**
- **Perfect timing:** Fresh data within days of funding announcements
- **Quality over quantity:** Manually verified contacts that actually work
- **Motivated buyers:** Companies with budget and growth momentum  
- **Zero research:** Qualified prospects delivered weekly, no searching

**Best for:** Anyone selling to funded startups and high-growth companies.

**The catch:** Narrow focus. Only covers funded companies.

## 5. Seamless.AI - Best for LinkedIn Addicts

**What it is:** Contact database that works directly inside LinkedIn and social platforms.

**Why it's useful:**
- **Real-time:** Finds contacts as you browse LinkedIn
- **Social first:** Built for how people actually prospect today
- **Accuracy:** Claims 95% accuracy through real-time verification
- **Simple:** Browser extension that just works

**Best for:** Reps who live on LinkedIn and social media.

**The catch:** Smaller overall database than ZoomInfo.

## 6. Lusha - Best for Small Teams

**What it is:** Simple contact database with browser extension. Built for smaller sales teams.

**Why it works:**
- **No complexity:** Easy to use without training your whole team
- **Honest pricing:** Clear tiers, no hidden fees  
- **Integrations:** Plays nice with popular CRMs
- **Free tier:** Actually generous free plan

**Best for:** Small teams who need reliable contacts without the complexity.

**The catch:** Fewer contacts and features than enterprise tools.

## 7. HubSpot Sales Hub - Best if You're Already on HubSpot

**What it is:** HubSpot's sales platform includes contact database features.

**Why it makes sense:**
- **No switching:** Everything stays in HubSpot
- **All-in-one:** Contacts, CRM, and marketing in one place
- **Actually usable:** HubSpot nails user experience  
- **Fair pricing:** Competitive with clear tiers

**Best for:** Teams already on HubSpot or wanting everything integrated.

**The catch:** Contact database isn't as comprehensive as dedicated tools.

## Which One Should You Pick?

| Tool | Best For | Starting Price | Database Size | Main Advantage |
|------|----------|----------------|---------------|---------------|
| Apollo.io | Complete sales workflow | $49/month | 275M+ contacts | Everything in one place |
| Clay | Highest accuracy | Usage-based | 75+ sources | Best data quality |
| Outreach.io | Enterprise teams | $90/month | 200M+ contacts | Advanced automation |
| FundedList | Funded startup targeting | $149/month | Curated weekly | Perfect timing |
| Seamless.AI | LinkedIn prospecting | $147/month | 400M+ contacts | Real-time social data |

## Before You Switch

Think about:

**What data do you actually need?** Comprehensive coverage or specialized lists?

**Team size matters.** Some tools work great for 3 people, terrible for 30.

**Budget reality check.** Factor in per-user costs and contract terms.

**Your current workflow.** How much disruption can you handle?

**Training time.** How technical is your team?

## The Real Talk

ZoomInfo isn't the only option anymore. These alternatives offer better pricing and often better experiences.

For most B2B teams, Apollo.io hits the sweet spot of features, price, and ease of use. 

If you're specifically targeting funded startups, FundedList gives you higher-quality prospects with perfect timing. 

For teams obsessed with data accuracy, Clay's multi-source approach is worth the extra complexity.
