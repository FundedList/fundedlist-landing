ZoomInfo is the 800-pound gorilla of B2B contact databases. With over 300 million contacts and powerful search filters, it's become the default choice for enterprise sales teams.

But that dominance comes with real downsides. ZoomInfo starts at $14,995 per year for their Professional plan, requires annual contracts, and has a reputation for aggressive sales tactics and price increases. Their data accuracy, while decent, isn't perfect. And their platform can be overwhelming for smaller teams who just need good contacts without enterprise bells and whistles.

If you're evaluating ZoomInfo alternatives, you're probably dealing with one of these pain points:

- **High cost:** ZoomInfo's pricing puts it out of reach for many growing companies
- **Data accuracy issues:** Contact information that's outdated or plain wrong
- **Contract lock-in:** Annual commitments with little flexibility
- **Feature bloat:** Too many features when you just need contact data
- **Poor customer support:** Long wait times and pushy upselling

Here are 7 alternatives that solve different pieces of this puzzle, depending on your team size, budget, and specific needs.

**Data needs:** Do you need comprehensive coverage or specialized data (like funded startups)?

**Team size:** Some tools work better for small teams, others for enterprise.

**Budget:** Factor in per-user costs and contract terms.

**Workflow integration:** How will this fit with your existing sales process?

**Learning curve:** How much training will your team need?

## The Bottom Line
