RocketReach has built a solid rep as a contact finder. 700 million professional profiles, decent accuracy for emails and phone numbers. It gets the job done for finding decision-makers.

The problem? It's expensive and limited.

Here's why teams ditch RocketReach:

- **Pricey:** $49/month just for basic features, goes up fast  
- **Basic search:** Simple filters compared to real prospecting tools
- **No outreach:** Find contacts, then what? Need another tool for emails
- **Credit system:** Pay-per-contact adds up quick for high-volume teams
- **Stale data:** Updates aren't real-time

If you're shopping for alternatives, you probably want better value, more features, or something specialized. Here are 8 options that do different things better.

## 1. Apollo.io - Best All-in-One Alternative

- **Better value:** More contacts and features for less money
- **Free tier:** Actually useful free plan
- **No credits:** Monthly subscription, not pay-per-contact

**Best for:** Teams that want contact finding plus outreach automation.

**The catch:** Data accuracy isn't quite as good for some industries.

## Before You Switch

Think about:

**What do you actually need?** Just contacts or full outreach workflow?

**Data types:** Email only or phone numbers and company info too?

**Volume:** How many contacts per month?

**Compliance:** Need GDPR or other data regulations?

**Budget:** Factor in subscription costs and usage fees.

**Current workflow:** How much disruption can you handle?

## The Bottom Line

RocketReach is decent at finding contacts. But it's not the only option and might not be your best option.

For teams wanting everything in one place, Apollo.io gives better value with contacts plus outreach tools. 

If you're targeting funded startups specifically, FundedList delivers higher-quality prospects with perfect timing.

Need the best data accuracy? Clay's multi-source approach wins.

Don't stick with RocketReach just because it's what you know. Pick what actually fits your prospecting workflow.
