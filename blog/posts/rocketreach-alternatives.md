RocketReach has built a solid reputation as a contact finding tool. With over 700 million professional profiles and a focus on accurate email and phone number discovery, it's become a popular choice for sales teams who need to find decision-makers quickly.

But RocketReach comes with significant drawbacks that make teams look for alternatives:

- **High cost:** Plans start at $49/month for basic features, enterprise pricing can get expensive quickly
- **Limited search capabilities:** Basic filtering compared to more advanced prospecting tools
- **No built-in outreach:** You find contacts but need separate tools for email sequences
- **Credit system:** Pay-per-contact model can get expensive for high-volume prospecting
- **Data lag:** Contact updates aren't always real-time

## Making the Switch: What to Consider

When choosing a RocketReach alternative, consider:

**Your primary need:** Do you just need contacts, or do you want outreach tools too?

**Data types:** Email only, or do you need phone numbers and company data?

**Volume:** How many contacts do you prospect per month?

**Compliance:** Do you need GDPR compliance or other data regulations?

**Budget:** Factor in both subscription costs and usage-based pricing.

**Workflow:** How will this fit with your existing sales process and tools?

## The Bottom Line

RocketReach is good at what it does, finding contacts. But it's not the only option, and depending on your needs, it might not be the best option.

For teams that want an all-in-one solution, Apollo.io provides better value with contact data plus outreach tools. If you're targeting funded startups specifically, FundedList delivers higher-quality prospects with perfect timing. And if data accuracy is paramount, Clay's multi-source approach is hard to beat.

The key is matching the tool to your specific prospecting workflow rather than defaulting to the most well-known option.
