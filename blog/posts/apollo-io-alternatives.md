Apollo.io has won over a lot of B2B sales teams. 275+ million contacts, built-in email sequences, decent free plan. It puts contact data and outreach tools in one place.

But Apollo isn't perfect.

You might be shopping for alternatives because:

- **Data accuracy sucks:** Contacts are outdated or just wrong
- **Email deliverability issues:** Your open rates tanked after switching to Apollo  
- **Limited search filters:** Can't find the exact prospects you want
- **Support is slow:** Takes forever to get help, especially on cheaper plans
- **Too much stuff:** The kitchen sink approach feels overwhelming

If any of this sounds familiar, here are 7 alternatives that might work better for you.

## 1. ZoomInfo - Best for Data Quality (If You Can Afford It)

**What it is:** The biggest B2B database. 300+ million profiles with enterprise-level search and filtering.

**Why it's better than Apollo:**
- **Data quality:** More accurate contacts, updated frequently
- **Search power:** Advanced filters that actually find who you're looking for
- **Enterprise ready:** Analytics and team management that scales  
- **Plays nice:** Integrates with pretty much every CRM and sales tool

**Best for:** Large teams with budget for premium data quality.

**The catch:** Expensive as hell. Starts at $14,995/year with annual contracts.

## 2. Clay - Best for Data Nerds

**What it is:** Data enrichment that pulls from 75+ sources to get the most accurate contact info possible.

**Why it beats Apollo:**
- **Accuracy wins:** Uses multiple sources to verify each contact
- **Fresh data:** Constantly updated, not stale database info
- **Finds hidden contacts:** Waterfall enrichment catches people others miss
- **Custom workflows:** Build data pipelines that actually work for you

**Best for:** Teams that care more about data quality than ease of use.

**The catch:** More complex setup than Apollo's plug-and-play approach.

## 3. HubSpot Sales Hub - Best if You're Already on HubSpot

**What it is:** HubSpot's sales platform with built-in contact database features.

**Why it works better:**
- **Everything connected:** Contacts, CRM, and marketing actually talk to each other
- **Actually usable:** HubSpot nails user experience  
- **No tool juggling:** One platform for everything
- **Great support:** Customer service that doesn't suck

**Best for:** Teams already using HubSpot or wanting everything integrated.

**The catch:** Contact database isn't as deep as dedicated prospecting tools.

## 4. Outreach.io - Best for Advanced Automation

**What it is:** Enterprise sales platform with serious automation and analytics.

**Why it beats Apollo:**
- **Better sequences:** More sophisticated email and call automation
- **Analytics that matter:** Track what's actually working
- **Enterprise features:** Team management and reporting that scales
- **Email deliverability:** Better reputation management than Apollo

**Best for:** Large teams that need serious automation and detailed tracking.

**The catch:** More expensive and probably overkill for smaller teams.

## 5. FundedList - Best for Targeting Funded Startups

**What it is:** Weekly lists of recently funded startups with verified founder contacts.

**Why it beats Apollo for startup outreach:**
- **Perfect timing:** Fresh data within days of funding announcements  
- **Quality over quantity:** Manually verified contacts that actually work
- **Motivated buyers:** Companies with budget and momentum
- **No research needed:** Qualified prospects delivered weekly

**Best for:** Anyone selling to funded startups and high-growth companies.

**The catch:** Narrow focus. Only covers funded companies.

## 6. Seamless.AI - Best for LinkedIn Prospecting

**What it is:** Contact database that works directly inside LinkedIn and social platforms.

**Why it's better:**
- **Real-time data:** Finds contacts as you browse LinkedIn
- **High accuracy:** Claims 95% accuracy through real-time verification  
- **Social selling first:** Built for LinkedIn-based prospecting
- **Simple to use:** Browser extension that just works

**Best for:** Reps who do most prospecting on LinkedIn and social media.

**The catch:** Smaller database and fewer automation features.

## 7. Lusha - Best for Simplicity

**What it is:** Simple contact database for teams that want contacts without complexity.

**Why it beats Apollo:**
- **Dead simple:** Easy to learn and use
- **Honest pricing:** Clear tiers, no surprises  
- **Solid accuracy:** Reliable contact quality
- **Quick setup:** Start using it immediately

**Best for:** Small teams who want reliable contacts without the learning curve.

**The catch:** Fewer features and smaller database than Apollo.

## Which One Should You Pick?

| Tool | Best For | Starting Price | Database Size | Main Advantage |
|------|----------|----------------|---------------|---------------|
| ZoomInfo | Enterprise teams | $14,995/year | 300M+ contacts | Best data quality |
| Clay | Data accuracy | Usage-based | 75+ sources | Highest accuracy |
| HubSpot | HubSpot users | $45/month | 200M+ contacts | Everything integrated |
| Outreach.io | Advanced automation | $90/month | 200M+ contacts | Sophisticated sequences |
| FundedList | Funded startups | $149/month | Curated weekly | Perfect timing |
| Seamless.AI | LinkedIn prospecting | $147/month | 400M+ contacts | Real-time social data |
| Lusha | Simplicity | $29/month | 60M+ contacts | Easy to use |

## Before You Switch

Think about:

**What do you actually need?** General prospecting or specific targeting?

**Team size matters.** Enterprise tools suck for small teams and vice versa.

**Data vs features.** Do you want better contacts or better automation?

**Your current stack.** How much integration chaos can you handle?

**Training time.** How technical is your team?

## The Bottom Line

Apollo.io is decent for most sales teams. Good balance of data, features, and price.

But it's not always the best choice.

If data accuracy is your thing, Clay's multi-source approach wins. 

For teams targeting funded startups specifically, FundedList gives you better prospects with perfect timing.

Need enterprise automation? Outreach.io has more sophisticated capabilities.

Don't just stick with Apollo because everyone else uses it. Pick what actually works for your situation.
