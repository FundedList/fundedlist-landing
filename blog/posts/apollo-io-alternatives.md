Apollo.io has become the go-to choice for many B2B sales teams. With 275+ million contacts, built-in email sequencing, and a generous free plan, it's easy to see why. Apollo combines contact data, outreach tools, and CRM features in one platform.

But Apollo isn't perfect. You might be looking for alternatives because of:

- **Data accuracy issues:** Some contacts are outdated or incorrect
- **Email deliverability problems:** Lower open rates due to reputation issues
- **Limited advanced filtering:** Compared to more specialized tools

- **Feature complexity:** The all-in-one approach can feel overwhelming

## Making the Switch: What to Consider

Before switching from Apollo, think about:

**Your primary use case:** Do you need general prospecting or specific targeting (like funded startups)?

**Team size and budget:** Some tools work better for enterprise teams, others for smaller organizations.

**Data vs. features trade-off:** Do you prioritize contact accuracy or built-in automation?

**Integration needs:** How important is it that your prospecting tool integrates with your existing stack?

**Learning curve:** How much training time can your team invest in a new platform?

## The Apollo.io Verdict

Apollo.io is a solid choice for most sales teams. It combines decent data, useful features, and reasonable pricing in one package. But it's not always the best choice.

If data accuracy is your top priority, Clay's multi-source approach delivers better results. For teams targeting funded startups specifically, FundedList provides higher-quality prospects with perfect timing. And if you need enterprise-grade automation, Outreach.io offers more sophisticated capabilities.

The key is matching the tool to your specific needs rather than defaulting to the most popular option.
