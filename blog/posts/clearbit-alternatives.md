Clearbit was a pioneer in B2B data enrichment, helping sales teams automatically fill in missing information about leads and contacts. Their API-first approach made it easy to enrich data from forms, CRMs, and other sources.

However, Clearbit shut down their core enrichment products in 2023, leaving many sales teams scrambling for alternatives. If you're looking to replace Clearbit or just want better data enrichment options, here's what you need to know.

Teams typically used Clearbit for:

- **Lead enrichment:** Filling in missing company and contact information
- **Form optimization:** Reducing form fields by auto-filling data
- **CRM data cleaning:** Updating incomplete or outdated records
- **Segmentation:** Adding firmographic data for better targeting
- **Lead scoring:** Using company data to prioritize prospects

Here are 8 alternatives that solve these data enrichment challenges, each with different strengths depending on your specific needs.

## Making the Switch: What to Consider

When replacing Clearbit or choosing an enrichment solution, consider:

**Data types needed:** Do you need company data, contact information, or both?

**Integration complexity:** How important is API simplicity versus advanced features?

**Data accuracy:** How critical is data quality versus speed and coverage?

**Volume:** How many records do you need to enrich per month?

**Budget:** Factor in both setup costs and ongoing usage fees.

**Team technical skills:** How complex of a solution can your team implement and maintain?

## The Post-Clearbit World

The shutdown of Clearbit created an opportunity for specialized providers to step up. While no single tool perfectly replicates Clearbit's approach, several options offer better value or specialized capabilities.

For most teams, Clay provides the best combination of data quality and flexibility, though with more complexity. If you want enrichment as part of a complete sales platform, Apollo.io offers better overall value. And for teams targeting funded startups, FundedList's pre-enriched approach eliminates the need for traditional enrichment altogether.

The key is matching the tool to your specific enrichment needs rather than trying to find a perfect Clearbit replacement.
