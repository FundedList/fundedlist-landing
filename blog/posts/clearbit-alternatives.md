Clearbit was the king of B2B data enrichment. Fill in missing lead info automatically. API-first approach that made integration easy.

Then they shut down their core products in 2023.

If you used Clearbit, you know what you're missing:

- **Lead enrichment:** Fill in company and contact info automatically
- **Form magic:** Reduce form fields by auto-filling data
- **CRM cleanup:** Update incomplete or stale records  
- **Better segmentation:** Add company data for smarter targeting
- **Lead scoring:** Use company info to prioritize prospects

Here are 8 alternatives that solve these problems. Each has different strengths depending on what you actually need.

## 1. Clay - Best for Data Nerds

**What it is:** Data enrichment platform that pulls from 75+ sources for the most complete information possible.

**Why it's the best Clearbit replacement:**
- **Multiple sources:** Combines data from dozens of providers for better hit rates
- **Real-time verification:** Checks data quality before you use it
- **Waterfall enrichment:** Tries multiple sources to find missing info  
- **Custom workflows:** Build data pipelines that actually work
- **API-first:** Similar technical approach to Clearbit

**Best for:** Teams that want the highest data accuracy and don't mind complexity.

**The catch:** More technical setup and steeper learning curve.

## 2. Apollo.io - Best for All-in-One

## 3. ZoomInfo Enrich - Best for Enterprise Quality (If You Can Afford It)

## Before You Switch

Think about:

**What data do you actually need?** Company info, contact details, or both?

**Integration complexity:** Simple API or advanced features?

**Data accuracy vs speed:** Quality or coverage?

**Volume:** How many records per month?

**Budget:** Setup costs plus ongoing usage fees.

**Technical skills:** How complex can your team handle?

## Life After Clearbit

Clearbit's shutdown created space for specialized providers to step up. No single tool perfectly replaces Clearbit, but several offer better value or specialized capabilities.

For most teams, Clay gives the best combo of data quality and flexibility, though it's more complex.

If you want enrichment as part of a complete sales platform, Apollo.io offers better overall value.

For teams targeting funded startups, FundedList's pre-enriched approach skips traditional enrichment entirely.

Don't try to find a perfect Clearbit replacement. Pick what actually fits your enrichment needs.
