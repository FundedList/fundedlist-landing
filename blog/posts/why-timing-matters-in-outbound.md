If you're doing outbound, you've probably noticed something: the same message gets wildly different results depending on *when* you send it.

Not what time of day — that matters too — but where the prospect is in their journey.

## The funding window

When a startup closes a round, something shifts. They go from "we need to conserve" to "we need to spend." New hires, new tools, new agencies, new everything.

That window — the first 2-4 weeks after funding — is the highest-intent moment you'll ever catch a founder in. They're actively looking for solutions. They have budget. They're making decisions fast.

Miss that window, and you're just another cold email.

## The data problem

The challenge is knowing *who* just raised and *when*. By the time it hits TechCrunch, the founder's inbox is already full. And most databases don't update fast enough to give you an edge.

That's why we built the [Weekly Report](/weekly-report/) — a CSV of every founder who raised capital in the past week, delivered every Monday. You get the data before the noise.

## What good timing looks like

Here's a real example. One of our subscribers sells marketing services to SaaS companies. They load our Monday report, filter for Series A companies with 10-50 employees, and send a personalized 3-line email.

Their results:
- **52% open rate** (industry average is 20-25%)
- **8% reply rate** (industry average is 1-3%)
- **3 new clients** in the first month

The message wasn't magic. The timing was.

## The takeaway

You don't need a better email template. You don't need a fancier tool. You need to reach the right person at the right moment.

Fresh data → timely outreach → real conversations.

That's it. That's the whole game.
