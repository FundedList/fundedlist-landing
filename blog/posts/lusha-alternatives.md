Lusha has earned a reputation as a reliable, straightforward contact finding tool. With its browser extension and simple interface, it makes finding email addresses and phone numbers feel effortless. Many sales reps appreciate its no-nonsense approach to contact discovery.

| Tool | Best For | Starting Price | Database Size | Key Advantage |
|------|----------|----------------|---------------|---------------|
| Apollo.io | Complete platform | $49/month | 275M+ contacts | All-in-one workflow |
| ZoomInfo | Enterprise quality | $14,995/year | 300M+ contacts | Highest accuracy |

## Making the Switch: What to Consider

When choosing a Lusha alternative, consider:

**Data volume needs:** How many contacts do you prospect per month?

**Geographic coverage:** Do you need strong international data or focus on specific regions?

**Contact types:** Do you need phone numbers as much as email addresses?

**Workflow integration:** Do you want contact finding as part of a complete sales platform?

**Accuracy requirements:** How critical is contact accuracy versus speed and coverage?

**Budget:** Factor in both subscription costs and per-contact usage fees.

## The Simple vs. Comprehensive Trade-off

Lusha's strength is its simplicity. You install the extension, browse profiles, and click to reveal contacts. It's straightforward and effective for many use cases.

But simple doesn't always mean best. For teams doing significant prospecting volume, Apollo.io provides better value with complete workflow integration. If contact accuracy is critical, Clay's multi-source approach delivers superior results. And for teams targeting funded startups, FundedList's timing advantage can dramatically improve conversion rates.

The key is choosing tools that match your prospecting volume and workflow rather than defaulting to the simplest option.
