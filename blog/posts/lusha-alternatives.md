Lusha earned its rep as a reliable, simple contact finder. Browser extension, clean interface, finds emails and phone numbers without fuss. Sales reps love its no-nonsense approach.

But Lusha has real limitations:

- **Small database:** Smaller coverage compared to bigger competitors
- **Credit system:** Gets expensive for high-volume prospecting  
- **Basic company data:** Minimal info beyond contact details
- **No outreach:** Find contacts, then what? Need another tool for sequences
- **Regional gaps:** Weaker coverage in certain markets
- **Too simple:** Limited advanced search and filtering

If you're shopping for alternatives, you probably want broader coverage, better pricing, or more complete prospecting features. Here are 7 options that solve different pieces of the contact finding puzzle.

**Geographic coverage:** Need strong international data or specific regions?

**Contact types:** Phone numbers as important as emails?

**Workflow integration:** Contact finding as part of complete sales platform?

**Accuracy vs speed:** How critical is contact accuracy vs coverage?

**Budget:** Subscription costs and per-contact usage fees.

## Simple vs Complete

Lusha's strength is simplicity. Install extension, browse profiles, click to reveal contacts. Straightforward and effective.

But simple doesn't always mean best.

For teams doing serious prospecting volume, Apollo.io gives better value with complete workflow integration.

If contact accuracy is critical, Clay's multi-source approach delivers better results.

For teams targeting funded startups, FundedList's timing advantage can dramatically improve conversion rates.

Don't default to the simplest option. Pick what matches your prospecting volume and workflow.
