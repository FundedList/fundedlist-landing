LinkedIn Sales Navigator became the standard for B2B social selling. Advanced search filters, InMail messaging, lead tracking. It helped millions of sales reps find and connect with prospects.

But Sales Navigator has real problems that make teams look elsewhere:

- **Expensive as hell:** $80+ per user per month adds up fast
- **LinkedIn only:** Your prospects aren't all on LinkedIn  
- **Message limits:** InMail credits restrict your outreach volume
- **No contact data:** Find prospects but no email or phone numbers
- **Feature bloat:** Complex interface with stuff smaller teams don't need
- **Account risks:** LinkedIn can limit or suspend accounts for aggressive outreach

If you're shopping for alternatives, you probably want better value, more data, or tools that work beyond LinkedIn. Here are 7 options that solve different pieces of the social selling puzzle.

## 1. Apollo.io - Best All-in-One Alternative

- **No message limits:** Send as many emails as you want
- **Solid search:** Filters comparable to Sales Navigator's targeting
