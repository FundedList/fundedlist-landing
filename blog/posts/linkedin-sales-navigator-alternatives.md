LinkedIn Sales Navigator has become the standard tool for B2B social selling. With advanced search filters, InMail messaging, and lead tracking, it's helped millions of sales professionals find and connect with prospects on LinkedIn.

But Sales Navigator comes with real limitations that make teams look for alternatives:

- **High cost:** $80+ per user per month adds up quickly for larger teams
- **LinkedIn-only:** Limited to one platform when prospects are everywhere
- **Message limits:** InMail credits restrict your outreach volume
- **No contact data:** You can find prospects but not their email or phone numbers
- **Complex interface:** Many features that smaller teams don't need
- **Account restrictions:** LinkedIn can limit or suspend accounts for aggressive outreach

If you're evaluating Sales Navigator alternatives, you're probably looking for better value, more comprehensive data, or tools that work beyond just LinkedIn. Here are 7 options that solve different pieces of the social selling puzzle.
