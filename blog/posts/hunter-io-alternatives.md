Hunter.io built its reputation as the go-to tool for finding email addresses. With domain search, email verification, and a simple API, it became popular among sales teams who need to find contact information quickly.

But Hunter.io has limitations that make teams look for alternatives:

- **Email-only focus:** No phone numbers or comprehensive contact data
- **Limited company data:** Minimal firmographic information beyond basic details
- **Credit-based pricing:** Can get expensive for high-volume prospecting
- **No outreach tools:** You find emails but need separate tools for sequences
- **Search limitations:** Basic filtering compared to comprehensive prospecting platforms
- **Accuracy inconsistency:** Email quality varies significantly by industry and region

**Workflow integration:** Do you want email finding as part of a complete sales platform?

**Accuracy requirements:** How critical is email deliverability versus speed and coverage?

**Budget:** Factor in both subscription costs and per-contact fees.

**Compliance needs:** Do you need GDPR compliance or other data regulations?

## The Email Finding Evolution

Hunter.io proved that specialized email finding tools could build successful businesses. But the market has evolved toward platforms that combine email finding with comprehensive prospecting and outreach capabilities.

For most teams, Apollo.io provides better value by combining email finding with complete prospecting and outreach tools. If email accuracy is paramount, Clay's multi-source approach delivers superior results. And for teams targeting funded startups specifically, FundedList's pre-verified approach eliminates the need for traditional email finding altogether.

The key is choosing tools that fit your complete prospecting workflow rather than optimizing for just one piece of the puzzle.
