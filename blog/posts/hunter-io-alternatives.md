Hunter.io built its rep as the go-to email finder. Domain search, email verification, simple API. It became popular because it just works for finding contact info.

But Hunter.io has real limitations:

- **Email only:** No phone numbers or company data
- **Bare bones company info:** Minimal details beyond basic stuff  
- **Credit system:** Gets expensive for high-volume prospecting
- **No outreach:** Find emails, then what? Need another tool for sequences
- **Basic search:** Simple filters compared to real prospecting platforms
- **Hit or miss accuracy:** Email quality varies a lot by industry and region

If you're shopping for alternatives, you probably want more complete data, better pricing, or tools that combine email finding with outreach. Here are 7 options that solve different pieces of the prospecting puzzle.
