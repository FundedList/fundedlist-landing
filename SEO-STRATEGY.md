2. Apollo.io alternatives (High competition = high value)
3. Rocketreach alternatives (High competition)
4. Lemlist alternatives (High competition)
5. Clearbit alternatives ($10-45 bids)
6. LinkedIn Sales Navigator alternatives
7. Crunchbase alternatives
8. Hunter.io alternatives
9. Lusha alternatives
10. Clay alternatives

**Format:** "X Alternatives: [Year] Guide" - what the tool does, what sucks, how FundedList is different. Each ~1,500-2,500 words. Include comparison table.

### 2b. Cold Email Nurture Sequence
Write the 6-8 email sequence for free 100 leads signups (Google Tasks item, overdue since Sep 2025). Each email links back to blog content. Conversion + SEO in one.

## Phase 4: Moat Content (Ongoing)

### Signal-Based Prospecting
FundedList's unique angle. Nobody else writes about this.
- What signal-based selling is and why it beats spray-and-pray
- Funding signals, hiring signals, tech stack signals
- How to build a signal-based pipeline from scratch
- Case studies from FundedList clients

This is the content that's hard to replicate and builds long-term authority.

## Publishing Cadence — Drip, Don't Dump

**Why drip:**
- Google rewards consistent publishing. A site posting 2-3x/week looks alive vs. a bulk dump that goes quiet.
- Each post gets its own crawl/index cycle.
- You can check Search Console after each post and adjust the next one based on what's getting impressions.
- Each post = a tweet, LinkedIn post, email touchpoint. 10 posts = 10 reasons to show up in feeds over 3-4 weeks.
- Internal linking builds naturally: post 2 links to post 1, post 3 links to both.

**Exception:** Seed 3 posts on day one so the /alternatives/ section doesn't look empty, then drip the rest.

### Phase 2 Schedule (Alternatives Posts)
- **Day 1:** Publish 3 posts (ZoomInfo, Apollo, Rocketreach)
- **Then:** 1 post every 2-3 days
- **All 10 done in ~3-4 weeks**
- Each publish = social post on X + LinkedIn

### Phase 3 Schedule (Guides)
- 1-2 posts/week (deeper content, takes more research)

### Phase 4 Schedule (Moat Content)
- 1 post/week (thought leadership, quality over quantity)

## Publishing Process
1. Sub-agent writes + humanizes all posts upfront
2. Uploaded as Decap CMS draft PRs (branch per post)
3. D reviews in CMS or GitHub PRs
4. Merge PRs on schedule (manually or via cron automation)
5. Netlify auto-deploys on merge
6. Post to X + LinkedIn on publish day

## Tracking
- Google Search Console for rankings
- Track keyword positions monthly
- Internal links: every new post links back to relevant pillar post
- After first week: check which alternatives post gets most impressions, double down on that angle
