# FundedList SEO & ASEO Strategy
*February 2026*

---

## The Big Picture

**Don't compete with Apollo/ZoomInfo on broad "B2B lead gen" keywords.** You'll lose. Instead, **own the "sell to funded startups" niche** — a keyword cluster that already has proven search demand but no dominant player combining data + outreach expertise + done-for-you delivery.

Your real content competitors are GrowthList.co, Fundraise Insider, and Revli — not the big platforms. And they're beatable because they're just data providers. You bring practitioner credibility.

---

## Format: Long Guides vs Short Pages?

**Answer: Both, but structured.**

- **3-5 pillar pages** (3,000+ words) — comprehensive guides on core topics
- **8-12 cluster articles per pillar** (1,000-1,500 words) — supporting long-tail topics
- **5-10 comparison posts** — "[Tool] alternatives" and "[X] vs [Y]" (these are 32.5% of all AI citations)
- **Weekly funding roundups** (300-500 words) — compounding SEO + freshness signal
- **Total: ~50-80 quality pages, not 500 thin ones**

For AI/LLM discovery specifically: use question-format H2 headers, answer directly in the first 40-60 words, then expand. Each section should stand alone as a citable chunk.
